# supportbee-export
A Python script that connects to the SupportBee API and downloads the tickets into a sqlite 3 database


A few notes:
1. This script was created as I needed a quick way to extract tickets out of SupportBee.
2. I am NOT a Python developer, so this is probably not the best-written code.
3. I designed it for our needs, so not all the fields are mapped.
4. You will need to install the libraries that this script uses.
5. When running on OSX, you might get an InsecureRequestWarning.
6. It takes a while to run. About 1000 tickets took north of 2 hours.

Hope this can be a good starting point for you.
